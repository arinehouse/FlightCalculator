Simple calculator for adding flight times in format h:mm:ss

A friend attending school for commercial aviation complained that he could not find any simple calculators to add flight times together. I built this very simple GUI that allows a user to enter times in h:mm:ss format (h can have any number in its place) and returns the total time in the same format.
