Simple calculator for adding flight times in format h:mm:ss

A friend attending school for commercial aviation complained that he could not find any simple calculators to add flight times together. I built this very simple GUI that allows a user to enter times in h:mm:ss format (h can have any number in its place) and returns the total time in the same format.

N.B. CalculatorGUI.java and FlightCalculator.java apply the same functionality, except that the former is a GUI and the latter is in text format output to the console. Both files can be run independently of each other, but both require information from the Time.java file.
